# MQTT with AES encryption and decryption

This project is an application of IoT (Internet of Things) by sending temperature and humidity reading data from the DHT22 sensor with NodeMCU to other NodeMCU via the MQTT mosquitto server. In sending data, encryption and decryption will be carried out from AES cryptography.

Library used:

For DHT22 https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library

For MQTT https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient

For AES https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs
